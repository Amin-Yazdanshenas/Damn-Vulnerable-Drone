    <p>Companion computers are small, embedded computers that are integrated into drone systems to augment the primary flight controller. They typically run on Linux-based operating systems and are designed to handle tasks beyond basic flight control, such as sensor data processing, computer vision, communication with ground control stations, and more. By offloading these tasks to companion computers, drones can perform complex operations and execute customized applications.</p>
