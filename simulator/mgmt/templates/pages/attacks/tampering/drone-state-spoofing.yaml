      Drone State Spoofing is a technique where an attacker injects fabricated information into a drone's communication system to misrepresent the drone's actual state to the Ground Control Station (GCS). For instance, an attacker might trick the GCS into believing the drone has entered an emergency mode, even when it's operating normally.

      This kind of spoofing can cause the GCS to initiate inappropriate responses, such as emergency landing protocols or return-to-home procedures. A bad actor might use this method to disrupt operations, divert a drone from its intended path, or to ground it prematurely. The impacts can range from operational disruption to potential safety hazards.
