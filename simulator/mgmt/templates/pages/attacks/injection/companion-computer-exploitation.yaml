      A companion computer is an onboard computer used alongside the main flight controller to extend the drone's capabilities. 
      By taking over the companion computer, an attacker can gain control over the drone's functions and behavior, potentially overriding the main flight controller commands.

        description: | 
          Find what changes you can make through the companion computer, for example. 
          ```
          curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/telemetry/stop-telemetry"
          ```
          Stops telemetry causing the Ground Control Station to lose communication.
