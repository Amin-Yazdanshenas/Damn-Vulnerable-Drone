      This scenario involves using Hydra, a popular brute-force tool, to crack the login credentials for the Companion Computer's 
      Web UI located at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>. By following this guide, you will learn how to perform a password attack on a web-based 
      interface and understand the principles of brute-forcing.

    steps:
      - title: Step 1
        description: | 
          Install Hydra if it isn't already installed on your system. (Kali should have it installed by default)

          ```sudo apt-get install hydra
          ```
      - title: Step 2
        description: | 
          Identify the login form on the Companion Computer's Web UI at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the form network action and find the username and password field names.


      - title: Step 3
        description: | 
          Prepare your wordlists. You'll need a list of potential passwords. You can use pre-built wordlists or create your own. There is a list of common passwords available here: <a href="https://github.com/nicholasaleks/Damn-Vulnerable-Drone/tree/master/simulator/mgmt/templates/pages/attacks/injection/passwords.txt">https://github.com/nicholasaleks/Damn-Vulnerable-Drone/tree/master/simulator/mgmt/templates/pages/attacks/injection/passwords.txt</a>

      - title: Step 4
        description: |
          Run Hydra to perform the brute-force attack. We will assume the userame is `admin` and use our downloaded passwords.txt file to brute force the form field at http://localhost:3000/login.

          ```hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid" -s 3000
          ```

      - title: Step 5
        description: |
          Review the results. Hydra will show you the correct username and password combination if it successfully cracks the login.

          If successfully you should get the following output

          ```[3000][http-post-form] host: localhost   login: admin   password: cyberdrone
          ```
