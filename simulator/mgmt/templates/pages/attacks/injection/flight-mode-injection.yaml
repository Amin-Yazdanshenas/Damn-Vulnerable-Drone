      Changing the flight mode of a drone using MAVProxy involves sending commands to the drone to switch between different modes like Stabilize, Guided, Auto, and others. 
      This process is also referred to as flight mode injection, where a new flight mode command is injected into the control system to alter the drone's behavior.

    steps:
    - title: Step 1
      description: | 
        Install MAVProxy
        ```
        sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-opencv python3-wxgtk4.0 python3-pip python3-matplotlib python3-lxml python3-pygame
        pip3 install PyYAML mavproxy --user
        echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

        ```
    - title: Step 2
      description: | 
       Launch MAVProxy and connect to the drone. You need to specify the
        connection string for 
      examples:
        - Serial Connection:
            Command: mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyUSB0 --baudrate 57600 --aircraft MyAircraft
        - UDP Connection:
            Command: mavproxy.py --master=udp:127.0.0.1:14550

        To see the list of available flight modes for your drone, use the `mode` command without any arguments.
        ```      
        mode
        ```
    
    - title: Step 4
      description: | 
        Use the `mode` command followed by the desired mode name to change the flight mode.
