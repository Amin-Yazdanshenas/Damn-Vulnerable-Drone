    content: |
      MAVLink packet sniffing involves intercepting the MAVLink messages exchanged between UAVs
      (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and ground control stations or between UAVs in a network.<br><br>
      
      By analyzing the captured packets, you can
      gain insights into the drone's operational status, commands being sent or received, and
      how the system handles various data types.

    steps:
      - title: Step 1. Install Wireshark
        description: |
          We will be using Wireshark to analyze the real-time MAVLink traffic. This should already be installed with your Kali Linux distribution. If not, you can install it by following the documentation here: <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html">https://www.wireshark.org/download.html</a>

      - title: Step 2. Install MAVLink on Kali
        description: |
          Install MAVLink on Kali (following the guide here: <a href="https://mavlink.io/en/getting_started/installation.html">https://mavlink.io/en/getting_started/installation.html</a>)
          ```sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
          git clone https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink.git --recursive
          cd mavlink
          python3 -m pip install -r pymavlink/requirements.txt
          ```

      - title: Step 3. Build MAVLink Libraries
        description: |
          Build libraries for your target dialect, specifying WLua as the target language. This process is described in the topic Generate MAVLink Libraries.
          ```python3 -m pymavlink.tools.mavgen --lang=WLua --wire-protocol=2.0 --output=mavlink_2_common message_definitions/v1.0/ardupilotmega.xml
          ```

      - title: Step 4. Update Wireshark Plugin
        description: |
          Update the plugin with correct ports. The last few lines of the plugin file specify the ports to be monitored.
          ```local udp_dissector_table = DissectorTable.get("udp.port")
          udp_dissector_table:add(14550, mavlink_proto)
          udp_dissector_table:add(14580, mavlink_proto)
          udp_dissector_table:add(18570, mavlink_proto)
          ```

      - title: Step 5. Import Plugin into Wireshark
        description: |
          To import the plugin into Wireshark: Copy the plugin file (`mavlink_2_common.lua`) into the Wireshark plugins directory.<br><br>

          On Linux systems this might be:
          ```/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wireshark
          ```
          or
          ```/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/wireshark
          ```
          or
          ```~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins
          ```
          or
          ```~/.wireshark/plugins
          ```

          Open Wireshark and follow the menu: Help > About Wireshark > Plugins<br><br>

          You should find the plugin in the list. For example, with the plugin created in the previous section you would see mavlink_2_common.lua

      - title: Step 6. Start Wireshark
        description: |
          Start Wireshark and select the correct interface to monitor. You should see the MAVLink packets being captured in real-time.

      - title: Step 8. Apply Decryption Settings
        description: |
          Use the WEP password obtained earlier to decrypt the MAVLink packets in Wireshark. Follow these steps:<br><br>

          1. Open Wireshark.<br>
          2. Go to `Edit` > `Preferences`. <br>
          3. In the Preferences window, expand `Protocols` and find `IEEE 802.11`. <br>
          4. Click on `IEEE 802.11` and then click on the `Decryption Keys` tab. <br>
          5. Click `Edit...` next to `Key #1`. <br>
          6. Enter the WEP key as `1234567890`. <br>
          7. Click `OK` to save the settings. <br>
          8. Start capturing packets and Wireshark will use the WEP key to decrypt the MAVLink packets.
