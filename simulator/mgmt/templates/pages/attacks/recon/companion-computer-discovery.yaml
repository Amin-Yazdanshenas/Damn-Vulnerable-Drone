      The companion computer is on the 10.13.0.0/24 network if you are running in non-Wi-Fi mode and 192.168.13.1 in Wi-Fi mode. Typically companion computers may have common services such as SSH, RTSP and maybe even an HTTP server running on them, making them prime targets for hacking into drone systems.

    steps:
      - title: Step 1. Ensure Docker Bridge Connection
        description: |
          Verify you are connected to the Docker bridge network. You can do this by running the following command:

          ```ip addr show
          ```

          You should have a bridge network with an IP address within the range of 10.13.0.0/24.

      - title: Step 2. Host Discovery
        description: |
          Use Nmap to scan the network range, excluding the IP addresses of the attacker machine and the simulator machine.

          ```nmap -sn 10.13.0.0/24 --exclude 10.13.0.1,10.13.0.5
          ```

          After running this scan, you should be able to identify the IP address of hosts on the network.

      - title: Step 3. Companion Computer Port Scan
        description: |
          Use Nmap to scan the specific network ports of the companion computer to identify enabled services.

          ```nmap 10.13.0.3
          ```

          After running this scan, you should be able to identify the open ports and active services on the companion computer.

          ```Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-02 19:00 EDT
          Nmap scan report for 10.13.0.3

      - title: Step 2. Host Discovery
        description: |
          Use Nmap to scan the network range, excluding the IP address of the attacker machine.

          ```nmap -sn 192.168.13.0/24 --exclude 192.168.13.10
          ```

          After running this scan, you should be able to identify the IP address of hosts on the network.

      - title: Step 3. Companion Computer Port Scan
        description: |
          Use Nmap to scan a wide range of network ports of the companion computer to identify enabled services.

          ```nmap 192.168.13.1
          ```

          After running this scan, you should be able to identify the open ports and active services on the companion computer.
